 Pathfinding Visualizer with Dijkstra’s Algorithm
An interactive pathfinding visualizer built with React using JSX, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This tool allows users to create custom grids, set start and end nodes, place walls, and visually explore how Dijkstra’s Algorithm finds the shortest path.
It's designed as an educational tool for understanding graph algorithms through dynamic, real-time animations.
